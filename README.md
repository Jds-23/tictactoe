# OnChain Tic-Tac-Toe

> A gas-optimized Tic-Tac-Toe implementation on Ethereum using bit manipulation and assembly code. README.md by Claude Code

This project explores smart contract optimization techniques by implementing a simple game with minimal gas consumption. The entire game state is packed into 24 bits, demonstrating efficient storage patterns for blockchain applications.

## What Makes This Different?

### Key Features
- **24 bits** to store entire game state (vs. traditional 288+ bits)
- **Significant gas savings** compared to standard implementations
- **Yul assembly** for optimized operations
- **Efficient storage** using bit manipulation

## Technical Approach

### Standard Implementation
```solidity
// Traditional approach
mapping(uint256 => uint8[9]) public boards;  // 288 bits per game
mapping(uint256 => address) public currentPlayer;
```

### Optimized Implementation
```solidity
// Bit-packed approach
struct Game {
    bytes3 board;        // 24 bits total
    address player1;
    address player2;
}
```

### Bit Layout

The game state is packed into 24 bits:

```
Bit Layout (24 bits total):
â”œâ”€ Bits 0-8:   Player 1 marks (9 positions)
â”œâ”€ Bits 9-17:  Player 2 marks (9 positions)  
â”œâ”€ Bit 18-22:  Unused (future expansion)
â””â”€ Bit 23:     Turn indicator (0=P1, 1=P2)
```

**Example Game State:**
```
Player 1 plays positions [0,4,8]: 0b100010001 (bits 0-8)
Player 2 plays positions [1,5]:   0b000100010 (bits 9-17, shifted)
Current turn: Player 2             0b1         (bit 23)

Combined: 0b1000001000100100010001 (binary)
         = 0x808121 (hex)
```

## Implementation Details

### Optimization Techniques

#### 1. **Bit Manipulation**
```solidity
// Check if position is occupied by either player
if (iszero(iszero(and(shl(index, 513), board)))) {
    revert() // 513 = 0b1000000001 - checks both player bits
}
```

#### 2. **Assembly Optimization**
Critical functions use Yul assembly for gas efficiency:

```yul
// Get player's board state in assembly
switch iszero(and(shl(23, 1), board))
case 0 {
    // Player 2's turn - extract bits 9-17
    playerBoard := shl(223, and(261632, board))
}
default {  
    // Player 1's turn - extract bits 0-8
    playerBoard := shl(232, and(511, board))
}
```

#### 3. **Pre-computed Winning Patterns**
Winning combinations are pre-computed for efficiency:

```solidity
winningMarks[bytes3(0x000007)] = true; // [0,1,2] - top row
winningMarks[bytes3(0x000111)] = true; // [0,4,8] - diagonal
// ... all 8 winning combinations
```

#### 4. **Event-Driven Architecture**
```solidity
event NewGame(address indexed player1, address indexed player2, uint256 gameId);
event Played(uint256 indexed gameId, bytes3 board);
```

## Architecture Analysis

### Advantages

1. **Gas Efficiency**
   - Reduced gas costs compared to standard implementations
   - Single SSTORE operation for moves
   - Bit-packed storage minimizes storage costs

2. **Performance**
   - Board state fits in CPU registers
   - Atomic operations prevent race conditions
   - Predictable gas costs

3. **Scalability**
   - Minimal storage per game
   - Supports multiple concurrent games
   - Suitable for high-frequency gaming

4. **Code Quality**
   - Pure functions where possible
   - Predictable execution paths
   - Documented assembly code

### Trade-offs

1. **Development Complexity**
   - Requires understanding of bit manipulation
   - Assembly debugging is challenging
   - Higher learning curve for contributors

2. **Code Readability**
   - Assembly code is less readable than Solidity
   - Bit operations require careful documentation
   - More complex to understand and maintain

3. **Flexibility Limitations**
   - Difficult to modify game rules
   - Adding features requires careful planning
   - Less suitable for rapid prototyping

## Testing Strategy

The project uses comprehensive fuzz testing to verify correctness:

### Fuzz Testing Approach
```solidity
function testFuzz_ValidMoves(uint8 position) public {
    vm.assume(position < 9);
    // Tests various game state combinations
}
```

### Test Categories
- **Valid Scenarios**: Legal moves and game flows
- **Invalid Positions**: Out-of-bounds and occupied cells  
- **Wrong Players**: Unauthorized and out-of-turn attempts
- **Game Isolation**: Multiple games don't interfere
- **State Invariants**: Game state consistency
- **Event Emissions**: Proper logging verification

### Coverage
- 15+ fuzz test functions
- Extensive randomized test cases
- Critical path coverage
- Edge case detection

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

1. **Create Game**: Call `newGame(player1, player2)`
2. **Make Moves**: Call `play(gameId, position)` where position is 0-8
3. **Check State**: Call `getBoard(gameId)` to see current state
4. **Find Winner**: Call `whoWon(gameId)` after game ends

```solidity
// Example game flow
uint256 gameId = ttt.newGame(alice, bob);
ttt.play(gameId, 4); // Alice plays center
ttt.play(gameId, 0); // Bob plays top-left
// ... continue until someone wins or draws
```
